## 7. First Card Design

Stampéo offers to design the first loyalty card for each Business User, based on provided assets (logo, colors, existing physical card, etc.).

Business Users retain ownership of their content (logo, images, text). By uploading content to the Platform, Business Users grant Stampéo a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute such content for the purpose of operating the service.

Business Users also authorize Stampéo to showcase their loyalty card and logo as commercial references on the Stampéo website (e.g., testimonials, card examples). Business Users may withdraw this authorization at any time by contacting support@stampeo.app.

## 9. End Customer Data

### 9.1 Responsibility

The Business User is the data controller for their End Customers' data. They determine what information is collected and for what purpose. Stampéo acts as a data processor in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR.

By subscribing and beginning to use the Platform, the Business User acknowledges and accepts the loss of their right of withdrawal.

However, the 30-day free trial without credit card allows testing the service with no commitment.

## 14. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by French law.

In case of dispute, the parties agree to seek an amicable resolution. Failing an amicable agreement within 30 days, the dispute shall be submitted to the competent French courts.

In accordance with applicable regulations, consumer Business Users may use a free mediation service. The competent consumer mediator will be indicated on the Platform website.

## 15. Changes to These Terms

Stampéo reserves the right to modify these Terms. Any substantial modification will be notified by email at least 30 days before taking effect.

Continued use of the Platform after the effective date of modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 16. Miscellaneous
