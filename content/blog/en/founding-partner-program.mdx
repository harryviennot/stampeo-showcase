## Why a Founding Partner Program?

Most software launches with a "build it and they will come" approach. We're doing it differently. We believe the best product is one shaped by the people who actually use it — local business owners who deal with customer loyalty every day.

That's why we created the Founding Partner Program. It's not just early access. It's a partnership.

## What You Get

### Lifetime Pricing

Founding partners lock in **€14.99/month for life** — that's the Pro plan price at nearly 50% off what it will cost after launch (€29.99/month). This price is locked to your account permanently. Even as we add features and raise prices, your rate stays the same.

### 3 Months Free

Your first three months are completely free. No credit card required upfront. Use that time to set up your loyalty program, get customers enrolled, and see the results before you ever pay a cent.

### All Pro Features

From day one, you get every feature:

- Unlimited customers
- Custom-branded Apple Wallet & Google Wallet passes
- Real-time push notifications
- Analytics dashboard
- Priority support

### Direct Influence on the Product

This is the part we're most excited about. Founding partners get a direct channel to our team. Every feature request, bug report, and piece of feedback goes straight to the people building the product.

We're not building Stampeo in a vacuum. We're building it with you.

  Founding partners get access to a direct communication channel with our development team. Feature requests from founding partners are prioritized in our roadmap. You're not talking to a support bot — you're talking to the people writing the code.

## Who Is It For?

The founding partner program is designed for local businesses:

- **Cafés and coffee shops** looking to reward regular customers
- **Bakeries and patisseries** wanting a modern loyalty solution
- **Restaurants** that want to bring customers back more often
- **Salons and barbershops** building a loyal client base
- **Retail shops** rewarding repeat purchases
- **Fitness studios** encouraging regular attendance
- **Any local business** that values customer retention

If you serve customers face-to-face and want them to come back, this program is for you.

## Our Commitment to You

As a founding partner, you're taking a chance on something new. We don't take that lightly. Here's what we commit to:

- **Your pricing is locked forever** — no bait-and-switch
- **Your feedback matters** — we read and respond to every message
- **We'll iterate fast** — if something doesn't work, we'll fix it quickly
- **We're transparent** — you'll know what we're building and why

We're not a faceless corporation. We're a small team that genuinely cares about helping local businesses thrive. The founding partner program is how we prove it.
