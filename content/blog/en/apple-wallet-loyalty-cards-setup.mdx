## Why Apple Wallet?

Apple Wallet is pre-installed on every iPhone. With over 1 billion active iPhones worldwide, it's the most accessible loyalty card platform available. Your customers don't need to download anything — the infrastructure is already there.

Apple Wallet passes support:

- **Custom branding** — your logo, colors, and business name
- **Real-time updates** — stamp counts update via push notifications
- **Location awareness** — passes can appear on the lock screen when customers are near your business
- **Barcode/QR codes** — for easy scanning at checkout

## Step-by-Step Setup with Stampeo

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Head to the onboarding flow and sign up. You'll need:

- Your business name
- Your business type (café, restaurant, bakery, salon, etc.)
- An email address

### Step 2: Design Your Card

This is the fun part. You'll customize your loyalty card:

- **Upload your logo** — PNG or JPEG, displayed on the pass
- **Choose your colors** — primary color that matches your branding
- **Set stamp count** — how many stamps until a reward (we recommend 8-10)
- **Define the reward** — "Free coffee", "50% off next visit", etc.

  Keep your card design simple. A clean logo on a solid brand color works best in the wallet. Overly complex designs get lost at small sizes.

### Step 3: Set Up Your QR Code

Your business gets a unique QR code that customers scan to join your loyalty program. You can:

- **Print it** and place it at your counter or on tables
- **Add it to receipts** for a post-purchase touchpoint
- **Share it digitally** via social media or your website

When a customer scans the QR code, they see a registration page and can add your loyalty card to their Apple Wallet with one tap.

### Step 4: Start Scanning

When customers visit and show their wallet pass, you scan their QR code using:

- **The Stampeo app** — free on iOS and Android
- **Any web browser** — no app installation required on your side either

Each scan adds a stamp instantly. The customer's pass updates in real-time with a push notification.

## What Your Customers See

From your customer's perspective, the experience is seamless:

1. They scan your QR code with their iPhone camera
2. A screen appears: "Add to Apple Wallet"
3. One tap — the card is in their wallet
4. On their next visit, they open their wallet and show you the pass
5. You scan, they get a notification: "You earned a stamp!"

The whole process takes under 10 seconds the first time and under 3 seconds for every subsequent visit.

## Tips for Success

**Place your QR code where customers naturally look** — at the counter, next to the register, or on table tents. The easier it is to spot, the more sign-ups you'll get.

**Mention it verbally** — "We have a digital loyalty card! Just scan that QR code." A quick verbal prompt dramatically increases adoption.

**Set achievable rewards** — 8-10 stamps feels attainable. Too many stamps and customers lose motivation. Too few and the reward doesn't feel earned.

**Watch your dashboard** — Track which customers are close to a reward. A customer at 7/8 stamps is highly likely to return soon.
